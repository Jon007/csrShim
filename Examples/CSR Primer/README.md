#List View Client Side Rendering (JSLink) Primer

The sample code and the tutorial write-up demonstrate basic client side rendering for List View web parts using the JS Link property. csrShim is not used/required in this tutorial. The goal is to simply provide a brief overview, basic extension points, and a simple to follow example.

The hope is that developers unfamiliar with this programming model can quickly get up to speed.

By the end of the tutorial, you should know:
- The basics of CSR
- Templates and Events available when using CSR
- CSR Best Practices

##Example Files
- [HallOfFame.js](HallOfFame.js) - A JSLink file to use in the tutorial
- [HallOfFame.xml](HallOfFame.xml) - A [PnP provisioning template](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-Guidance/blob/master/articles/Introducing-the-PnP-Provisioning-Engine.md) that can be used to setup the list used in the tutorial (manual steps are provided, but this is a nice shortcut if you are familiar with PnP)
- **README.md** - This file, wow!

##Required csrShim Files
- None! This is just basic CSR (JSLink)
